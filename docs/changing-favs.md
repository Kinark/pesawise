Just add an icon for any of them.

You can gather the icon names from here: https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/icon#icon-set

The framework use the version 4.7.0 of Font Awesome, however they may update the version of the package along with the documentation. So, if this happen, you can have an eternal reference in here: https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/

**However, there's two important things if you're going to use the official reference:**
> * All the dashes must be replaced by spaces, so `address-book` would become `address book`
> * The outlined versions of the icons

Or you can just update the semantic-ui-react package. That's your choice. But it'd be a little more complicated.
